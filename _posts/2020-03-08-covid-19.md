We want the Provenance Week community to know that we are closely monitoring the development of the COVID-19, and that we have plans to make a virtual conference, may the circumstances require it. For now, we want to leave you with the [latest news from UNC Charlotte regarding COVID-19 as of March 8th, 2020](https://emergency.uncc.edu/coronavirus): "There are no suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus at UNC Charlotte or the immediate surrounding area." Further updates will be posted on the Provenance Week webpage.
