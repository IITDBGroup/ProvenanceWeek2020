title: Deadline Extension and COVID-19
---

The Provenance Week organization team is closely monitoring the COVID-19 developments and is taking the following measures to assure everyoneâ€™s safety, and, at the same time, the success of the conference: 

- The abstracts and paper submissions for IPAW and TaPP are extended to March 29th

- We will allow authors to present their papers virtually, so there will be no need to be present at the event in order to participate. We will release other instructions regarding this possibility later on.  

- Author who have already submitted their papers and feel their paper is ready for review can send an email to the conference chair (vanessa@ic.uff.br for IPAW, and thomas.pasquier@bristol.ac.uk for TaPP) and let them know the paper can be reviewed. This would alleviate the impact of the deadline extension on the PC members 
  
Please consider submitting your work!

Be safe,
The Provenance Week Team
